## Assignments and grading

Grades will be based on the following exams and assignments:

Exam or assignment | Points possible
:--- | :---
Exam 1 | 200
Exam 2 | 200
Reflection essay 1 | 150
Reflection essay 2 | 150
CEDAW country study: presentation | 150
CEDAW country study: essay | 150

That makes for a total of 1000 points for the semester. Final grades will be calculated as follows:

A = 930 – 1000 A- = 900 – 929 B+ = 880 – 899 B = 830 – 879 B- = 800 – 829 C+ = 780 – 799 C = 730 – 779 C- = 700 – 729 D = 600 – 699 F = \< 600
